# Getting Started: ASSESSMENT

The first step in your journey is to better understand who you are, and how to communicate that identity to others.
We use both standardized personality testing and professional assessments for all of our staff members to help us figure out how to collaborate and communicate effectively.

How much you decided to share is up to you. However, it is important that your assigned mentor has access to these files.

## Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI)

The MBTI is a popular personality assessment tool that has since replaced astrological signs as a mainstream fun way of learning more about how one processes and communicates information through behavioural patterns.

## PrinciplesYou (Big 5) Assessments

This is the one we will base our primary corporate recommendations on. While the MBTI is fun, we do not base our business decisions on personality tests as they are subject to change and vary more widely than a professional assessment such as the Big 5.
